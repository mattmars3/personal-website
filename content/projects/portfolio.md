# Why Build a Portfolio Website?
There are quite a few reasons why I decided to create this website, and still plenty of uncertainties concerning the future function of the website.
My goal is to create a platform where I can share information about my hobbies and life in a format that I can control. I can integrate other projects
that I create into this portfolio website and hopefully create a product that paints a picture of my past and current endeavors.

I will outline some objectives and functions of the website below
- Connect to my other social media/professional platforms
- Preview other projects I am working on
- Describe current events and projects in detail through the blog page

## Tech Stack for this website
This website was created with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) which is a static site generator written in [Go](https://go.dev/). Despite my intermediate level
of web-development skill, I still opted to use a static site generator because of its content-first focus. 

All of the source code is hosted on Github in [this](https://github.com/mattmars3/personal-website) repository. I am using [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/)
to host my website and use a CI/CD pipeline through Amplify that redeploys the website when I update the Github repository. This aligns with my content-first mindset
since it is now incredibly easy to update the content on my website. I hope to demonstrate this focus through frequent updates of my blog page and up-to-date information
about current projects.
